this is some source to help you read polyhedra files.
i am disinclined to put all of the 9th edition clibrary in
here so i just include getfields. the only problem you might
have is fio (F* routines). just change
	Fprint		fprintf
	sprint		sprintf
	fprint		fprintf	(unbuffered)
	Fgetc		getc
	Fflush		flush
(its not hard).
let me know of any comments and i will update this readme
